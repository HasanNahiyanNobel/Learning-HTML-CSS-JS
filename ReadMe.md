## Notes from HTML Tutorials
1. HTML Introduction
2. What is HTML?
	- He says, HTML is not a programming language, it's just a markup. That makes such an absolute and immediate sense, I feel dumb a bit.
3. HTML Syntax and Structure
4. Your First Web Page
5. Head and Body Tag
	- The `<head>` contains metadata, CSS and JavaScript references.
	- The `<body>` contains all the visual components.
	- CSS is referred in a single `<link>` tag.
6. Headings and Text
7. Heading Structure
	- The simple basics of heading hierarchy.
8. Default Browser Styles
9. The `<img>` Tag
10. HTML Links
	- Learnt how *go to top* works.
11. HTML Lists
12. HR and BR Tags
	- Learnt the use of `<hr>` tag.
13. The `<div>` Tag
14. IDs and Classes
	- I feel IDs are more like bookmarks in an html page.
15. Adding CSS to HTML
	- Three ways:
	- Inline style using the `style` attribute
	- Within `<style>` tags in the head of the document
	- By linking up a stylesheet in the head
16. Adding JavaScript to HTML
	- Again, three ways:
	- In the `<script>` tag of head or body
	- Linking a `.js` file in head or body
	- Inline, just a sweet stuff
17. What to Do Next



## Notes from CSS Tutorials
1. Introduction to CSS
2. What is CSS?
3. Default Browser Styles
4. Basic CSS Syntax
5. Inline and Embedded Styles
6. External Style Sheets
7. CSS Comments and Where to USE
8. Targeting Elements with CSS
9. Targeting Classes and IDs
	- Classes are like MS Word styles. I can use it to use a custom style.
10. CSS Conflicts and the Cascade
	- In case of conflicts, CSS takes the bottom-most rule.
11. Inheritance
12. Selector Specificity
	- IDs get the most priority. Then classes, and then elements.
	- `#id_m element_n {rules}` means all `element_n`s having `id_m` will get that rule.
13. The Important Declaration
14. Targeting Multiple Elements
15. Descendent Selectors
16. Child Selectors
17. Adjacent Selectors
	- Sounds interesting, but as I'm more okay with MS Word styles, I think I'll use `class` instead.
18. Attribute Selectors
19. Pseudo Selectors
	- This can change style based on hover. I love this!
20. Hover, Active, and Visited Effects
	- Also, there are active and visited effects. Wow.
21. First and Last Child Selectors
	- Again, this *is* a powerful tool, but I'm still stuck with MS Word style. But I think I'll give this tool (and the following ones) a try.
22. First and Last of Type Selectors
23. nth Child Selectors
	- nth child takes even and odd parameters. Cool.
	- And it even takes linear functions of n!
